==Description==


maven plugin to wrap html fragments into a javascript template used by angular js client

===Introduction===

You often have many small html files if angular js is used. Minimization exists for js/css.
We also need such tool for  htmls. This is particular useful if your  html templates are used in UI 
library. One such example is [http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap UI Bootstrap]. For exmaple, 
bootstrap UI has many small [https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/tree/master/template fragments as template].
The final distribution is a single javascript file with all these htmls.  This plugin 
consolidates html files into angular js template.   It is built into maven compile phase.
